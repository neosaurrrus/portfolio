# Hey there!
I am a Web Developer based in Maidenhead in the United Kingdom. Creating clever (or cleverly simple) things is what makes my days fly by. As the Web continues to reinvent itself at a mind-boggling pace, it's great being along for the ride!

## This is what I can do
I primarily use Javascript, React, Node, Express, Ruby and Rails. I also use more old-fashioned things like listening to clients to make sure all that fancy tech makes someone's day.

## Let's be sociable
Happy to get to know like-minded folk. See Github for my work, big and small. Check out my blog on Dev.to for an idea whats rattling around in my mind and ping me on Twitter

# Stuff I made
Some of my favourite things I have made for public consumption. There are plenty of repos to be found on my Github but lets see at a few in more detail here!

## Prompt Planning Poker
Easy Estimation for SCRUM Teams. This app is an online version of the popular sprint planning tool, Planning Poker. Built with React and Redux on the Front End, with Ruby on Rails on the backend.

## Invite.li
A No-fuss way to find dates between friends. The main focus was to be quick and painless with minimal hurdles. React on the Frontend while Firebase handles database duties here

## SubsChef
An app to record ingredients that can be swapped for other ingredients. Great if you don't have a certain recipe. Built entirely with Ruby on Rails
